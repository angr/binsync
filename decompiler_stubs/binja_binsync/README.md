BinSync is a decompiler collaboration tool built on the Git versioning system to enable fined-grained reverse
engineering collaboration regardless of decompiler. BinSync is built by [mahaloz](https://github.com/mahaloz), 
the [angr](https://angr.io) team, and the [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu) research lab. It's also due
in large part to its use by the [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net) hacking team. 

## Quick Start
Please read our [Quickstart Docs](https://binsync.net/docs/home). You can skip installing, since you've done
that already.
